# Password-Generator
## Description 
Password Generator with characters ranging from 1-50 characters including numbers, uppercase and lowercase alphabets, as well as symbols from the ASCII codes. 
### Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- VS Code
### Motivation 
This project was created to understand the concept of generating random characters, and to use that in a practical scenario. 
### Challenges 
This project is a [follow-along](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKo9pDKKHnc&t=2s) tutorial. Therefore, there is not enough focus on individual learning and brainstorming, unlike creating a personal project from scratch. 
### Working
The main chunk of this project consists of the functionalities for password generation. However, there is a good amount if styling involved too. 
#### Functionality using JavaScript
- The main JS code generates passwords by using a function for random generation of ASCII codes. These codes are translated into uppercase and lowercase letters, with symbols and numbers, and then joined using `.join('')` to result in a string
- A little bit of code is used for toggling light/dark mode
#### Styling using CSS 
The main styling is done for changing themes, and checkboxes. 
- The toggle for light/dark mode is achieved using checkboxes using the `transition` property
- The checkboxes for choosing characters are styled mostly using `box-shadow` and `transition` 
### Future Plans for this Project 
- The project is partially responsive, and needs improvement. 
- The design also needs to look much cleaner. Using a CSS framework would be a better option for clean UI.
